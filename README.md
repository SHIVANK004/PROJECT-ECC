# PROJECT-ECC
Python is a popular multi-purpose programming language widely used for its flexibility, as well as its extensive collection of libraries, which are valuable for analytics and complex calculations.
Python’s extensibility means that it has thousands of libraries dedicated to analytics, including the widely used Python Data Analysis Library (also known as Pandas).
For the most part, data analytics libraries in Python are at least somewhat derived from the NumPy library, which includes hundreds of mathematical calculations, operations, and functions.

PYTHON LIBRERIES FOR DATA ANALYSIS

FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING

Numpy - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

Scipy - SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. 
        It includes modules for statistics, optimization, integration, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, signal and image processing, ODE solvers, and more.
        
DATA MANUPULAITON         
Pandas (Python data analysis) is a must in the data science life cycle. It is the most popular and widely used Python library for data science, along with NumPy in matplotlib

PLOTTTING AND VISUALIZATION

Matplotlib – Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

Seaborn - Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.

Plotly - Plotly.py is an interactive, open-source, and browser-based graphing library for Python

Bgplot - Bqplot is a 2-D visualization system for Jupyter, based on the constructs of the Grammar of Graphics.
